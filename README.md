## Requirements:

#### Set up Google Sheets API: Integrate the Google Sheets API into your Spring application to authenticate and authorize access to the Google Sheets document. You'll need to create a Google Cloud Platform project, enable the Google Sheets API, and generate API credentials (client ID and secret).

#### Create UI components:

 - Create a homepage that displays a list of records retrieved from the Google Sheets document.
 - Implement a form for adding new records to the Google Sheets document. The form should validate input fields and display appropriate error messages.
 - Enable editing of existing records in the Google Sheets document. Implement an edit button or link next to each record that allows users to modify the data.
 - Implement a delete button or link next to each record to remove it from the Google Sheets document.
 
 #### Implement CRUD operations:

 - Retrieve data from the Google Sheets document and display it on the homepage.
 - Implement functionality to add new records to the Google Sheets document using the form.
 - Enable editing of existing records and update the corresponding data in the Google Sheets document.
 - Implement functionality to delete records from the Google Sheets document.
 
 #### Error handling and validation:

 - Implement appropriate error handling for any API failures or exceptions that may occur during Google Sheets integration.
 - Validate input fields in the form to ensure data integrity before adding or updating records.

#### Security:

 - Ensure that only authenticated users can access the web application and perform CRUD operations on the Google Sheets document.
 - Implement appropriate security measures to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.

#### Testing:

Write unit tests to verify the functionality of the CRUD operations and other critical components of your application.

#### Documentation:

 - Provide clear and concise documentation on how to set up and run your application.
 - Document any important design decisions or considerations related to the integration with Google Sheets.


#### Note: You may use libraries like Apache POI or Google Sheets API libraries for Java to facilitate the integration with Google Sheets.
